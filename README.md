# Agreement-on-the-Line: Predicting the Performance of Neural Networks under Distribution Shift
by Christina Baek, Yiding Jiang, Aditi Raghunathan, and Zico Kolter from Carnegie Mellon University. 

This is the repository for our paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13089. 
We provide the model predictions and the code used to generate Figure 4 (For experimental details, see _Section 5.3 Estimating performance along a training trajectory_) in the main body of our paper. The code for our algorithm is in the **aline** method in _agreement_trajectory.ipynb.
